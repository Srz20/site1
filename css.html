          <div class="accordion-body">Reflow is a process of a web browser for re-calculating the position/size of your
            DOM elements in order to display a page.
            Reflow occurs when:
            Insert, remove or update an element in the DOM.
            Modify content on the page, e.g. the text in an input box.
            Move a DOM element.
            Animate a DOM element.
            Take measurements of an element such as offsetHeight or getComputedStyle.

          <div class="accordion-body">Mixins is a feature of SASS which works like a function in JavaScript. It is used
            to
            avoid the repetition of the code. We may use the same code again and again in CSS. Suppose, we have to use
            border: 1px solid red; font-size: 10px; border-radius:5px; several times in a web page then we will use
            mixins. We need to use @mixin name(){ code} and to import @import name();
            Our browser can’t read SASS file or file with extension .scss. So, the output of this file will not be
            displayed on the browser. We need to convert sccs file to css file that happens through a compiler. This
            compiler is available in the VS code as an extension. We need to download the extension called live sass
            compiler and once it is installed, go to the scss file and click on Watch Sass and copy mixin.css from live
            Sass compiler from output section.

            <ul type="decimal">
              <li>Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN):- </li>
              <p>
                We know that, the load time increases when users are physically far from the server. With CDN, user
                requests are redirected to the nearest server.
                As a result, the content is delivered to a user quicker and a website works faster. This is a rather
                expensive, but quite effective way to optimize the load time.
              </p>

              <li>Use better host for the website:-</li>
              <p>
                Sharing hosting. That’s the cheapest way to get your site online in a short time and for a low fee but
                shared hosting isn’t as fast as VPS or a dedicated server because
                in sharing hosting CPU, disk space, and RAM are shared with other sites that also use
                the same server.
                Virtual Private Servers and dedicated servers are much faster. VPS uses multiple servers for content
                distribution. VPS will be the optimal solution for you If your
                website has the average traffic or I have eCommerce site with traffic spikes in some periods,
                The most expensive hosting option is to use a dedicated server which can be your own physical server. In
                this case, you pay a server rent and hire a system
                administrator to maintain it.
              </p>

              <li>Optimize the size of images on your website:-</li>
              <p>
                Whenever we make any website, we may use lots images specially in commerce website that takes to much
                data and slower the web-page.
                The best way to reduce the image size without compromising its quality is to compress images using tools
                such as ImageOptim, JPEGmini, or Kraken.
                The procedure may take a bit of time but it’s worth it. Another way to reduce the image size is to use
                the HTML responsive images and attributes that adjust image size based on user display
                properties.
              </p>

              <li>Reduce the number of plugins:-</li>
              <p>
                We use different plugins to add specific features suggested by third parties. Unfortunately, the more
                plugins are installed, the more resources are needed to run them. As a result, the website works slower
                and also security issues can appear. Before using the plugins, we should first run the performance tests
                on the web-page to find out which plugins are slowing down the website and then try to avoid plugins
                that load a lot of scripts and styles or generate a lot of database queries. The best solution is to
                keep only the necessary ones and ensure that they are kept up to date.
              </p>

              <li>Minimize the number of JavaScript and CSS files:-</li>
              <p>
                If any website contains a lot of JavaScript and CSS files, it leads to a large number of HTTP requests
                when the website visitors want to access particular files. These requests are treated individually by
                visitor’s browser and slow down the website work. If we reduce the number of JavaScript and CSS files,
                it will load the website quickly. We can also try to keep all JavaScript into one and also do so with
                all CSS files. This will reduce the overall number of HTTP requests. There are a lot of tools such as
                WillPeavy, Script Minifier, or Grunt to minify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files quickly.
              </p>

              <li>Use website caching (kashing):-</li>
              <p>
                We know that when my website is accessed by a lot of users at one time, servers work slowly and need
                more time to deliver the web page to each user. Caching is the process of storing the current version of
                the website on the hosting and presenting this version until the website is updated. This means that the
                web page doesn’t render over and over again for each user.
                Cached web page doesn’t need to send database requests each time.
                If the website is developed on WordPress then we can use plugins like: W3 Total Cache or W3 Super Cache.
              </p>

              <li>Implement Gzip Compression:-</li>
              <p>
                Gzip Compression is an effective way to reduce the size of files. It minimizes the HTTP requests and
                reduces the server response time. Gzip compresses the files before sending them to the browser. On the
                user side, a browser unzips the files and presents the contents. This method can work with all files on
                your website. We can enable Gzip on your website by adding some lines of the code or via a utility
                called gzip.
              </p>

              <li>Reduce the use of web fonts:-</li>
              <p>
                Web fonts have become very popular in website design. Unfortunately, the use of web fonts has a negative
                impact on the speed of page rendering. Web fonts add extra HTTP requests to external resources. The
                following measures will help you reduce the size of web font traffic:
                Use modern formats WOFF2 for modern browsers;
                Include only those character sets that are used on the site;
                Choose only the needed styles
              </p>

              <li>Detect 404 errors:-</li>
              <p>
                A 404 error means that a “Page isn’t found”. This message is provided by the hosting to browsers or
                search engines when the accessed content of a page no longer exists. In order to detect and correct a
                404 error, you can use error detection tools and plugins. Xenu’s Link Sleuth, Google Webmaster Tools
                (GWT)
              </p>

              <li>Reduce redirects:-</li>
              <p>
                Website redirects create additional HTTP requests which negatively impact performance. We can use
                Screaming Frog to quickly identify redirects.
              </p>

              <li>Database optimization in CMS:-</li>
              <p>
                Database optimization is the an effective way to increase performance. If we use a content management
                system (CMS) packed with complex plugins, the database size increases and the website works slower. For
                instance, the WordPress CMS stores comments, blog posts, and other information that take up a lot of
                data storage. Each CMS requires its own optimization measures and also has a number of specific plugins.
                For WordPress, for example, you may consider WP-Optimize.

          <div class="accordion-body">Whenever we make any website and use HTML elements like head, paragraph and others
            and when we see the result without applying the css3/css. It may look different in different browsers as it
            may take default padding, margins or font-sizes of the browser and it may be different in different
            browsers.
            The output of the HTML element in which we don’t apply any style may look different as if takes 5px padding
            in
            browser, it is also possible that it will take 7px padding in any other browser. So, output may be different
            in different browser as browser takes its default padding, margin or font-size is called User Agent
            Style-sheet.
            In another word, The default css that we get from different browsers called User Agent Style-sheet.
            But, when we reset the padding, font-size and margin to zero using *{padding:0, margin:0} then padding and
            margin will be set to 0 for the entire web-page and it is called resetting the CSS.
            Reset is the process to reset the HTML elements to ensure it looks alike in different browsers. Here, in all
            the browsers, padding and margin will be zero.
            The latest way of reset is normalize CSS. It is an alternate of CSS reset of HTML5 called normalize CSS. It
            only targets the style that needs to be normalized.
            We can visit normalize.css to download the link and link in HTML file.
            Normalize CSS helps to display the content similar in all the browsers. It also corrects bugs for common
            browser dependencies.

              width, margin, padding will not work properly so to use margin, padding, width and
              height we need to make them block by using display: inline-block; it will become block in one line.
              To show these in different lines we need to use span{display:block}. Now, span will work like block
              element.
              We use display: inline; to align all the block element in one line p{display:block;} Inline Block
              Elements: Inline-block elements are similar to inline elements. Inline elements will become inline block
              elements when we add padding and margins, height and width values to them.

              CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It’s a style sheet language that determines how the
              elements/contents
              in the page are looked/shown. CSS is used to develop a consistent look and feel for all the pages.
              The latest version of CSS is CSS3.
            </p>

            <p>CSS was developed and is maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium(kansawtium) (W3C). It was first
              released on December 17, 1996.
              CSS framework.</p>
            <p>
              CSS is a library and its framworks are Bootstrap, Bulma, Skelton(isskeltn), Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
              A style sheet is a file on which codes like padding, margin, page size are written in form of code and
              that
              help to make the layout beautiful.

              Calss is a way of styling the HTML element. It is not unique but id is unique.

          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>
              The four types of media properties are print, speech, and screen and all. Example of using print-media
              type: 
              Media query means writing css for different media like print, screen and speech and all, all means all the
              three medias.
            <p>
              Print means how the print out should be if print is taken out or writing css for print.
            </p>
            <p>
              Screen means how should be the web when it is shown in mobile screen,tablet screen like ipad, monitor
              screen, laptop screen or app screen. So, writing css for different size of screens is called media screen.
              Speech that reads the content for the blind.
            </p>
            <p>
              viewport is the size of the screen and it can be different for different screen.
              Commonly used view-ports are 320px, 480px, 760px, 960px, 1200px, 1600px etc.
              900 -1680 for laptops
              700 to 900 for tabs in px,
              320 to 540 px for mobile
            </p>
            </p>
            <p>
              @media screen and (max-width:900px){ .container{ width:50%} }
              The CSS that you write will be applicable till the screen viewport or width is between 0 to 900px. 900px
              is
              called break-point and it can be different for different screen. Here, .container{ width:50%} means if the
              screen width is between 0 to 900px then container class width will be 50%.
              We can write different conditions as well
              instead of max-with like min-width, min-height etc as shown below. If we want to give two conditions like
              max-width:200px and min-width:100px then we can use logical operators like “and, not, only” . Please note
              that we need to use meta viewport under head tag and set internal CSS (like under head not internal) and
              media query should be written after internal CSS or at the end of the CSS files under head tag then only
              media query will work properly. To use two conditions, we will write like @media screen and
              (max-width:800px) and (orientation:landscape) and (min-width:200px){}

            <p>
              As per WWW(w3c) every HTML element is a box and each element or box has its own properties. Box model is
              used to understand these properties. In another word, a box model is a combination of content, padding,
              margin and border. It is used to determine the height and width of the rectangular box. When we give
              height
              and width, it is applied to the content.
            </p>

            <P>
              The border-box and content-box are two values of box-sizing.
              The box-sizing tells how the width and height of an element are calculated.
              In another word, we can say that it will tell whether padding and border should include or not.
              We have two properties of border-box.
              box-sizing:border-box;
              width will not increase. On the contrary, the actual width will be 200(width/content-width) - padding(from
              right and left) - border(from right and left) If width is 200px and padding is 10px from right and 10px
              from
              left and border is 5px from left and 5 px from right.
              So, actual width will be 200 - 20 - 10 = 170px

            </P>
            <P>
              box-sizing:content-box; It is a default property and width will increase.
              The size of the width will increase if we take 10px border from left & right and 10px padding from left &
              right and the total width will be 240px . The margin is not calculated in box-sizing:border-box;

            </p>
            <p>
              Responsive website
              We can make our website Responsive which means its width & height will adjust automatically according to
              the
              screen size with the help of media query launched in css3. Responsive website helps to change the design
              according to the screen.

            <p>
              Disadvantages of CSS are given below:
              Browser Compatibility: Some style selectors are supported and some are not. We have to determine which
              style
              is supported or not using the @support selector).
            </p>
            <p>
              Cross Browser issue: Some selectors behave differently in a different browser).
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no parent selector: Currently, Using CSS, you can’t select a parent tag.

            Ways to implements CSS
            <p>1. Inline Style
              Inside the HTML tage with style property.
              <xmp>
                <h6 style="border: 2px solid black; background: green; width: 60px;"> I am sarfraz.</h6>
              </xmp>
            <p>
              Limitation of Inline style page is that pseudo class and elements can not be used in inline style.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Inpage Stype Page
            </p>
            It is applied within head
            <xmp>

              <head>
                <style>
                  h6 {
                    border: 2px solid black;
                    background: green;
                    width: 60px;
                  }
                </style>
              </head>
            </xmp>
            <p>
              3. External Style Sheet
              style.css is file name css extension.
              <xmp>
                <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
              </xmp>
            </p>
            4 - Import a style sheet file (An external file imported into another CSS file):
            </p>
            <p>
              Another way to add CSS is by
              using the @import rule. This is to add a new CSS file within CSS itself.
              Import rule is used to use one css file to another css file if you have two or more than two css files.
              Here, it is not required to make different links for different css file. We will define one link and
              import
              another css file into the defined css file or linked css file.
            </p>
            <p>
              To use the another css file into a defined or linked css file we use @import "path/to/style.css"; // This
              is
              for relative path
            </p>
            <p>
              We have second method as well @import url("https://www.sarfraz.com/style.css"); // This is for absolute
              path
            </p>
            <p>
              Third way @import “printstyle.css’’ print; //Will apply css of printstyle.css when print is taken out.

            <p>
              It tells us about the ways to give height and width .
              There are two types of units.
            </p>
            <p>
              Absolute Unit which is fixed like pixel, length, inch etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              Relative Unit which changes according to the main/parent div like % and the width will be responsive
              depending on screen size or parent div/container size.
            </p>
            <p>
              EM is a CSS unit relative to the font size of the parent element, while rem is a CSS unit relative to the
              font size of an HTML element. The rem unit means "The root element's font-size" (rem stands for "root
              em").
            </p>
            <p>
              percentage is relative to the parent div but rem and
              em are relative to the browsers/viewport. em and rem(relative em) are used to give font size. 1em=parent
              font size. 2em=2 x parent font size 0.5=half of parent font size. 1em is usually equal to 16px and it will
              convert the font size into 16px if parent font size is not defined. rem is also like em but it is not
              dependant on the parent div on the contrary it depends on root tag size like HTML because it is a root tag
              so need to write html{font-size:10px;} under style then 1rem=10px or browsers font-size that can be
              checked
              from settings.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use rem and em to make the font size responsive.
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align:center; font-weight: bold; color:rgb(66, 22, 213);">Viewport</h3>
            <p>

              Viewprot is the size of the screen. <br>
              It’s a CSS unit used to measure the height and width in percentage with respect to the viewport. It is
              used
              mainly in responsive design techniques. The measure VH is equal to 1/100 of the height of the viewport. If
              the height of the browser is 1000px, 1vh is equal to 10px. Similarly, if the width is 1000px, then 1 vw is
              equal to 10px.
            </p>
            <p>

              vw(viewport width & vh(viewport height) work according
              to the viewport width and viewport height. if width:100vw and height:100vh; then the width and height will
              be according the screen viewport width and height. if width:50vw and height:50vh;then the width and height
              will be half or 50% of the screen viewport width and height if width:50vmax; then viewport mein jiska
              width
              jyada hoga(maximum) (screen ko chhota bada karne par) hoga usi ke 50% div ho jayega. if width:50vmax; then
              viewport mein jiska width jyada hoga(manimum) hoga usi ke 50% div ho jayega.
            </p>
            px is not cascade. em maintains relative size. you can have responsive fonts. Em, will cascade 1em is
            equal
            to the current font-size of the element or the browser default. If u sent font-size to 16px then 1em =
            16px.
            The common practice is to set default body font-size to 62.5% (equal to 10px).
            pt(point) are traditionally used in print. 1pt = 1/72 inch and it is a fixed-size unit.
            %(percentage) sets font-size relative to the font size of the body. Hence, you have to set the font-size
            of

              We use font-family for changing the font face.
              Font-family means which font you want to apply or want to see an an output of text on your web-browser.
              like
              arial,verdana etc.
              font-family:arial; means it will set arial family on the text but it we write it
              as font-family:arial,Helvetica,verdana; 
            </p>
            <p>
              When you open the website, it will check your system if your system has Arial font if yes then Arial
              family
              will apply or else Helvetica will apply. If arial is not available but Helvetica is available if both are
              not available then verdana will apply if available or if all the three fonts are not available browser’s
              default font will apply.

              We can set font-family for body, header, footer, side-bar differently if we want.

              It is used to download and set any font size so that you can see the same font size as others can see.
              When
              you use this rule, it makes the web slow as request to server to display the same font. We can use to two
              website to download the font. download the font in which you can see the web-font kit as it supports all

              Position is used to position the HTML element. It is a property and it has five values (Absolute,
              Relative,
              Fixed, Sticky, and Static). The position property needs helper properties like left, right, top and bottom
              and they are necessary to use with position to make changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we have to move any HTML element horizontally, we us left and right . Plus value will move rightwards
              and Minus value will move leftwards.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we have to move any HTML element vertically, we us top and bottom . Plus value will move downwards
              and
              Minus value will move upwards as you can see in the image given below.
            </p>
            <p>
              Absolute will move the HTML element from the screen you are working on but if we set position:relative in
              the parent div and position:absolute; in the child div then position:absolute will work according the
              parent
              div in which position:relative applied.
            </p>
            <p>

              Relative will move from its own position.

            </p>
            <p>
              Fixed will fix the image or anything and if you scroll the content, image will not move but in position:
              relative/absolute; image will move.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sticky will also fix the image but after moving the till the value you set. like top:50px then it will
              move
              to 50px top and then it will fix.
            </p>
            <p>

              Static is the default value which does not make any change.The only reason we would ever set an element to
              position: static is to forcefully remove some positioning that got applied to an element outside of your
              control.

            </p>
            <p>

              Note:- If there are two divs and parent div has value position:relative then child div will move according
              to parent div if position:absolute; applied in child div because absolute of child div will be parent div.

              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>
                  The keyword initial can be used to reset or restore its default value.
                  We know that every property has its default value like paragraph has default color “black” which will
                  appear on the browser when we don’t reset/give any color to paragraph tag.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Similarly the default font-size of any paragraph is 16px which will apply if we don’t give any
                  font-size. So, if we want to know the default value of any property then we can use initial. For
                  example
                  p{color:initial},
                  it will set black color in the paragraph because initial return the default value. Similarly,
                  p{color:inherit} will give the color given in parent of paragraph tag if any else return the default
                  one.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unset:- Unset will return initial value if nothing has been set in the parent div else inherit. <br>
                  Agar parent mei kuch set hai to parent ka value yani inherit lega (display mein nahi lega kyonki
                  display inheritance property nahi hai) aur agan parent mein kuchh set nahi hai to initial yani CSS ka
                  default value lega. <br>
                  Revert- will take the browser's default value; div{display: revert;} will return block(in 2 lines for
                  2 divs but div{display:initial} will return inline(in one line for 2 divs) because initial takes the
                  CSS default value. <br>
                  Difference between Unset and Revert:- <br>
                  Unset will return initial value whereas Revert will return the user aget stylesheet default value(also
                  called browsers style sheet value or value set by different browsers for different properties).

                  Whenever we make any website, we need to check whether that website is working fine or looking fine in
                  different screen sizes and different browsers or not and to check this, we need to do some test and
                  that
                  test is called cross browsers compatibility testing or browser-specific styling testing to fix the
                  issues.
                  We also call it CBT(Cross Browser Testing)
                </p>
                <p>
                  Web Testing Coverage(The data of all the browsers, devices, Screen-Sizes and Operating Systems on
                  which
                  website will be tested)
                  We create three kinds of applications.
                  1.Web Application:- We will focus on Web Application and we will test it in different browsers like C
                  hrome, Firefox, IE etc. and laptops of different companies of different screen-sizes. So, we need to
                  check/test our web in these different platforms to ensure my web will work and look fine.
                  2.IOS Application
                  3.Android Application
                  We can write browser-specific styles separately in different sheets and load that only when the
                  specific
                  browser is used. This makes use of the server-side rendering technique. In another word, write CSS for
                  different browsers like Chrome, IE and load IE style when user is viewing the website on IE or Chrome
                  style when viewing in Chrome and so on.
                  We can use auto-prefix for automatically adding vendor prefixes in the code.
                  We can also use normalize.css or reset CSS techniques.

                </p>
                <p>
                  There are some ways for avoiding browser compatibility issues too. They are as follows:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    DOCTYPE ERROR
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    It is better to use DOCTYPE because older browser versions check for DOCTYPE tag at the
                    beginning and if not found, the application rendering won't be proper.We know that !doctype(document
                    type) is used to tell the version of document of HTML to the browser. If we write
                    <!DOCTYPE html> it means that we have used html5 and the other developer will understand that in
                    this
                    document html5 has been used and edit accordingly. It is not case sensitive. So, can be written in
                    small.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    Browser Detection:-
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    Browser Detection is used to get user’s data like which browser the user is using,
                    what the version and agent of the browser are so that we do the coding accordingly.
                    In javaScript we use code to detect the AppName(Browser’s name), AppVersion(Browser’s version) and
                    agent
                    using
                    navigator.appName(to get app) navigator.aapVersion(for version) and navigator.userAgent.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    Validation of HTML and CSS code:
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    We know the codes we have written in the HTML and CSS files will be
                    used by different browsers. So, we need to validate or check these codes like if closing tags,
                    semicolons
                    are missing or syntax is wrong which can create problems while rendering the code. We can use tools
                    for
                    validate such as W3C, HTML and CSS validator or Jigsaw.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    To ensure our website look alike in all the browsers used by the users. If we don’t do so,
                    browser's default value such as line-height, color, font-size, and margins etc. will be applied and
                    it
                    can
                    be different for different browsers.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    Layout compatibility:-
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    We need to check this as well and better to use flex and grid for making layout
                    to avoid layout issues.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    Use friendly libraries and frameworks like bootstraps
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Separate Style Sheet for different browsers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Test on real devices:
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    It is good to use tools like Test sigma for this purpose that enables us to test
                    in real devices.
                  </p>
                </ul>

                In short, we can use BrowserStack for Cross Browser Testing using Selenium.

                        supported by a particular browsers or not.
                     
                        <h3>@support can be used for mulitple conditions as well.</h3>  

                         @support(display:flex) or (display:-webkit-flex){   #main{display:flex;}  

                         /** Here 'or' operator means css for #main{display:flex;}  will work if anyone of these two
                    conditions are

                         compatible for the display:flex and (display:-webkit-flex) means not compatible as using old
                    version of
                         Chrome and firefox as used -webkit. Similarly, we can use 'and' operator. In 'and' operator
                    both the condition
                         should run in the browser you are using then only the command will work.

                <p>
                  Progressive rendering is a techniques used to improve the performance of a web-page so that web page
                  can
                  display as quickly as possible.

                </p>
                <p>

                  Rendering means converting code into an interactive web page that our users can see and utilize its
                  functionality. <br>
                  and Progressive means doing things such that the highest priority thing will be
                  done first, after that less priority thing will be done and in this manner, work will be completed.
                  So, Progressive Rendering means rendering the web page in such a manner that high priority component
                  will be rendered first and then low priority component will be rendered. <br>

                   So the priory of our component should depend upon the viewport. This means those components that come
                  in the viewport after loading the website for the first time should get high priority and those
                  components that are below that viewport should get low priority.
                </p>
                <p>

                  Client-Side Rendering means rendering pages directly in the browser using JavaScript. <br>
                  All logic, data fetching, templating and routing are handled on the client or browser on which you are
                  working on rather than the server.

                </p>
                <p>
                  We have different ways to Achieve Progressive Rendering- <br>
                  1. Lazy Loading of Image: Lazy loading of an image means loading an image when it is about to come in
                  the viewport instead of loading all the images initially at once. This will lead to the progressive
                  rendering of the web page because here the high-priority image is the image that is initially in the
                  viewport and is loaded first and the low-priority image is that which is about to come in the viewport
                  and will be loaded. <br>
                  2. Not processing all the CSS initially: Most of the developers have a habit of adding all CSS in the
                  head section and because of that whole CSS will be processed first before processing of HTML. But to
                  achieve progressive rendering we should only add that much CSS in the head section that is necessary
                  for those HTML that will be in the viewport at the start. After that, Add the remaining CSS in the
                  body before the HTML tags to which it will be applied.

                </p>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">client and Server side rendering</h2>
                <p>
                  In Client-Side Rendering the content is rendered on the client side but In Server-Side Rendering, the content is first rendered on the server side and
                  then send to the client side. <br>
                  For example:-
                  In Client-Side Rendering, when a user visits any web
                  page then request made by the user is sent to the server and server returns response of the request in the form of HTML and CSS file to the client side but these html and csss will be empty or have no content because all content is rendered by javascript. <br>
                  Now, clients will start parsing html and css but there will be no content because html has no
                  content so we will see a blank page. <br>
                  After parsing the parser will come across the JavaScript because we put the script tag before closing tag of body. Now, parser will start
                  downloading the JavaScript where our content available and once the JavaScript is executed, all necessary content is rendered and then application becomes
                  viewable and interactive.<br>
                  Note:  I would like to inform you that parsing html and css is fast but not
                  JavaScript and this is why a blank page will be rendered to the user until the JavaScript is executed
                  because the HTML has no content so the user will have to wait JavaScript to be loaded and executed. <br>
                  This is the reason that Client-Side Rendering is slower than the Server-Side Rendering. <br>

                  In server side rendering, first loads the HTML and CSS file on itself and then processes it and then
                  sends the processed web page to the client side. After getting that webpage, the User can see the
                  webpage and the browser will be waiting for the JS file to be loaded. Till the JS file is not loaded,
                  the User can only see the webpage but can’t interact with it. Interaction with the web page is only
                  possible with the help of JS(Javascript). <br>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Progressive Rendering Explaination</h2>

                In progressive Rendering, the web page is divided into different parts on the
                  basis of priority. So different parts will be rendered according to Server-Side Rendering
                  and sent to the client side. This means that here first whole page will not be rendered on the server
                  instead, high priority part of the page is rendered and sent to the client side, then low priority
                  part of the page is rendered and sent to the client side. <br>
                  Benefits of Progressive Rendering: These are some of the major benefits of Progressive Rendering-
                  It improves the load time of the website and that eventually leads to a better User Experience.
                  It optimizes the critical rendering path. Critical rendering path is referred to those steps that are
                  done between receiving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and converting them into a visual web page.
                  It helps us to overcome the drawback of server-side rendering and client-side rendering. <br>

                complete when it reaches 100%.

                <p>
                  <mark> @keyframes animation-name{from{css properties} to{css properties} } </mark>We need to take a
                  selector to
                  use animation
                  called @keyframes. We need to take two key words within the keyframes
                  <mark>from{css properties}</mark> The place from where we have to strat css and
                  <mark>to{css property}</mark>The place from where we have to end css. <br><br>

                <p>
                <p>ANIMATION WITH FILL-MODE</p> fill-mode is used to give differnt conditions on differnt percentage or
                stage of
                start
                to end. Like if we want that when animation reaches at 20% the color of the div is blue,
                when it reaches at 50%, the color of the div should be red and at 100% black then we will
                use animation-fill-mode.Its first value is none means default and it will bring no change.
                backward means start the animation till the time delay is not over which means if we set
                delay for 5s the default or the original background which is here yellow will display for
                5 second and then animation will start.
                </p>
                <p>
                <p>ANIMATION WITH FILL-MODE WITH BACKWARD VALUE</p> backwards means showing the initial stage like the
                resule
                when
                element is at 0% means the width & height you have set for the div.
                In the given picture, background: yellow; is at 0%
                </p>
                <p>
                <p>ANIMATION WITH FILL-MODE WITH FORWARD VALUE</p> In forwards, the animation will stop at 100% and the
                color
                will
                display as it is set so it will not come to the initial stage.
                Yeh, 100% mein jo set hoga usse dikhayega like width is 300px
                background is black and initial state nahi dikhega.

                <p>
                <h2>TRANSITION</h2> It is used to give smoothness when you hover, without it if we apply, it will jerk.
                transition:width, height, background 2s, 2s, 2s; is shorthand of transition-property.
                transition:all 2s: all will apply for width, height etc. and 2s if all the duration is same.
                transition-delay means after how long hover should start or end.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h2>TRANSFORM 2D</h2> It is used to rotate the div or any image. transform: rotate(30deg);will rotate
                30degree.
                degree can be written in minus as well.
                transform: (30deg);
                </p>
                <P>
                <h2>TRANSFORM 3D</h2>
                If the width and height of two divs are same if we use transform: rotateX(60deg); in the child div then
                then
                child
                div will act like a curtain closing horizontally. perspective gives a 3d look and also show how it is
                moving.
                the more is the perspective(800px) the better 3d will look as when we sit in the cinema hall and watch
                from the
                balcony, it gives clearer than sitting at front. perspective is used in 3d only. perspective(800px).
                perspective-origin has defaulf value (center center) horizontally & vertically.
                </P>
                <P>
                <h2>perspective</h2>
                Perspective is applied in parent div. perspective-origin:left/right/top/
                bottom/left bottom/bottom right/ top right/20% 35%
                </P>
                <p>
                <p>With skewX</p>It will rotate the div from x asix(horizontally) which means left bottom border and
                rotate
                with the angle you set as given below:-<br><br>
                </p>
                <h2>transform-origin</h2>Earlier the point of the div was center from where the div was being moved.
                Now,
                we can
                change the origin like green color in the picture is the left-bottom(x asix(horizontal)
                se left and y axis(vertical) se bottom)and yellow is right top. It can be given in % as
                well like transform-origin:100% 20%;
                <p>
                <h2>transform:translate()</h2>It is used to move the div horizontally and vertically but the text inside
                it will not
                move. I will move 100px horizontally to the right and it can be written as
                transform: translateX(100px 45px); the value can be given in minus to move left and up
                <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                <h2>transform:scale()</h2>It is used to increase the width and height of the div. transform:scale(2)
                means
                double the
                size horizontally and vertically but transform:scaleX(2) means double the size horizontally
                and transform:scaleY(2) means double the size vertically.
                </p>
                <p>
                <p>transition n transform</p> We will write #ex1:hover{transform: rotate(360deg); under style and
                transition:transform
                1s;
                so that when we hover ex1 div, it will rotate 360 degree within 1 second.
                </p>
                <P>
                <p>BACKFACE </p>It needs to be applied in parent div and also it will work with
                transform: rotateY(30deg); or rotateX() for horizontally. It helps to show the back of any image/div
                when we rotate any div by 180deg in 3D/2D. We will be able to the back when we rotate any div by 180deg.
                In the given example if we set backface-visibility:hidden; the backface does not appear when we hover
                but when backface-visibility:visible; the backface appears as you can see.
                </P>

                  CSS sprites are used for combining multiple small images in a single larger image and then use that
                  single larger image into multiple small images in CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, if I have three different flags for different country. I will combine them and make a
                  larger image and at the time of using that larger image in CSS we will use the three flags separately
                  whenever I need whichever country flag.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the development of the project, we may need several small icons, social media icons or small images
                  and the more images we use will go to the server more times. So, we will combine the all small images
                  in
                  one so that it reduces the number of HTTP requests to get data of multiple images. Now, we will send
                  only one single request.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The limitation of image sprites is that it can be used as a background image only not work in direct
                  image. <br>
                  It reduces the number of HTTP requests to get data of multiple images as they are acquired only by
                  sending a single request. <br>
                  It helps in downloading assets in advance that help display icons or images upon hover or other

                  A CSS Preprocessor is a tool that allows to do almost everything that we can do in JavaScript and
                  other
                  programming language. Like – variables, functions, mixins , for loop, nesting, and some extend of
                  inheritance.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Some of the preprocessors are SASS, LESS AND STYLUS.
                  SASS: Sass is the acronym (संक्षिप्त रूप) A·kruh·nuhm for “Syntactically /sɪnˈtæk.tɪ.kəl.i/ Awesome
                  Style Sheets”.
                  There are two ways to write SASS syntax.
